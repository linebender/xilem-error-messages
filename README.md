# xilem-error-messages

This repo collects small snippets of code that use the Xilem APIs.

We should add to it over time as people report interesting errors with confusing or overly verbose error messages.

The examples depend on a pinned version of Xilem so that the error messages stay predictable.
Someone bumping the Xilem dependency should also update the error messages.
Ideally, we'd also pin the Rust compiler version.
